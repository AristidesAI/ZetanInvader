**THE INVADERS ARE HERE.** Relive the golden age of arcade gaming with Zetan Invader, a high-octane space shooter optimized perfectly for the Apple Watch. Experience the classic "shoot 'em up" gameplay with a premium modern feel and a stunning dot-matrix aesthetic.

**PRECISION CONTROLS** Forget clunky touch controls. Zetan Invader uses the Digital Crown for ultra-responsive horizontal movement. Combined with high-frame-rate interpolation, your ship glides across the screen with surgical precision. Tap anywhere to unleash a barrage of green laser fire.

**STRATEGIC DEFENSE** Use the environment to your advantage. Deploy behind destructible asteroid barriers to shield yourself from incoming enemy fire. Watch as the asteroids take realistic damage, chipping away until they vanish—use them wisely, or you’ll be left wide open!

**ELITE ENEMY AI** It’s not just a shooting gallery. The alien grid moves with increasing speed as you clear their ranks. Watch out for the Bonus Spiral Aliens—rare, high-value targets that move in unpredictable patterns. Sack them for 50 bonus points to climb the leaderboard!
