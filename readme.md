# Zetan Invader
A retro-futuristic arcade survival shooter for Apple Watch — inspired by classic "Invader" games and Fallout-style green-on-black aesthetics. Pilot the Zetan ship through a hazardous digital asteroid field. Dodge asteroids, outmaneuver enemy fighters, and score as many points as possible before your run ends. The UI evokes a dot-matrix "green phosphor" display, with tactile haptics to enhance immersion.

### Controls
- Digital Crown — Rotate to steer your ship left and right. Movement is smooth and responsive for precision control.
- Tap Screen — Fire plasma bolts to destroy enemies and break asteroids.
- Haptics — Taptic feedback accompanies hits, explosions, and special events for better situational awareness.


### Gameplay
- Lives: You start with 3 lives. Each hit removes one life; losing all lives ends the run.
- Objective: Survive as long as possible while racking up score by destroying enemies and collecting bonuses.
- Difficulty: The spawn rate and behavior of enemies scale up over time to increase challenge.
- Scoring: Standard enemies give points, while rare targets (e.g., Bonus Spiral Aliens) yield higher rewards.

Core loop:
1. Steer through the field (avoid collisions).
2. Shoot enemies and destructible asteroids for points and cover.
3. Preserve lives and survive longer to reach higher difficulty and scores.
4. Improve your best run and unlock bragging rights on the High Score table.


### Features
- Retro Aesthetic: Authentic green-on-black dot-matrix visuals and pixel-perfect sprites.
- Haptic Feedback: Taptic Engine support for blasts, collisions, and important in-game events.
- 3-Life System: Tactical health that rewards careful dodging and positioning.
- Smooth Motion: High-frame-rate interpolation and crown-driven controls for precise movement.
- Visual FX: Sprite-less particle explosions and smooth animations for satisfying feedback.
- Pick-Up-And-Play: Instant start — minimal loading and immediate gameplay.
- Adaptive Difficulty: Enemy behavior and spawn rates scale as you survive longer.
- Elite Enemy AI: Enemies coordinate and accelerate as you clear waves; watch for high-value bonus targets.

### Tips & Strategy
- Use asteroids as temporary cover, but remember they can be destroyed.
- Conserve movement — small crown adjustments are usually better than large swings.
- Prioritize high-value targets (Bonus Spiral Aliens) when it's safe — they give a large score boost.
- Keep an eye on spawn patterns; the alien grid accelerates as waves clear.
